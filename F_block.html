                        and silvery-white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air, and it is soft enough to be cut with
                        a steel kitchen knife[citation needed]. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series,
                        and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also has a
                        stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also considered one of the rare-earth
                        elements. Cerium has no biological role in humans and is not very toxic.

                        The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis. Samarium has no significant

                        rare-earth element. Gadolinium reacts with atmospheric oxygen or moisture slowly to form a black
                        coating. Gadolinium below its Curie point of 20 °C (68 °F) is ferromagnetic, with an attraction
                        to a magnetic field higher than that of nickel. Above this temperature it is the most
                        paramagnetic element. It is found in nature only in an oxidized form. When separated, it usually
                        has impurities of the other rare-earths because of their similar chemical properties.

                        Ytterbium is a chemical element with the symbol Yb and atomic number 70. It is the fourteenth
                        and penultimate element in the lanthanide series, which is the basis of the relative stability
                        of its +2 oxidation state. However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state
                        is +3, as in its oxide, halides, and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of
                        other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules.
                        Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points
                        differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides.

                        Actinium is a chemical element with the symbol Ac and atomic number 89. It was first isolated by
                        Friedrich Oskar Giesel in 1902, who gave it the name emanium; the element got its name by being
                        wrongly identified with a substance André-Louis Debierne found in 1899 and called actinium.
                        Actinium gave the name to the actinide series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium
                        and lawrencium in the periodic table. Together with polonium, radium, and radon, actinium was
                        one of the first non-primordial radioactive elements to be isolated.

                        which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are
                        unstable; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5
                        billion years. The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146
                        neutrons and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and uranium-235 (which has 143
                        neutrons). Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. Its
                        density is about 70% higher than that of lead, and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten.

                        It is a transuranic member of the actinide series, in the periodic table located under the
                        lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.
                        Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley, California,
                        at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, as part of the Manhattan Project.
                        Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the
                        heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945.
                        Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear
                        reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100 grams of americium. It is widely

                    <p>
                        Fermium is a synthetic element with the symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It is an actinide and
                        the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence
                        the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has
                        not yet been prepared.[3] A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived
                        with a half-life of 100.5 days.

                        Mendelevium is a synthetic element with the symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A
                        metallic radioactive transuranium element in the actinide series, it is the first element by
                        atomic number that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron
                        bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic
                        element. It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with
                        charged particles. A total of seventeen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being
                        258Md with a half-life of 51 days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17 hours)
                        is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.

                        Nobelium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol No and atomic number 102. It is named
                        in honor of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and benefactor of science. A radioactive
                        metal, it is the tenth transuranic element and is the penultimate member of the actinide series.
                        Like all elements with atomic number over 100, nobelium can only be produced in particle
                        accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of twelve nobelium
                        isotopes are known to exist; the most stable is 259No with a half-life of 58 minutes, but the
                        shorter-lived 255No (half-life 3.1 minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be
                        produced on a larger scale.
